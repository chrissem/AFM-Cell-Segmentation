# Sub-micro scale cell segmentation using deep learning

The codes in this repository shows how we implemented various types of U-nets including training from scratch and transfer learning for cell segmentation at sub-micro scale. We distribute our codes with a GNU GPLv3 license. Codes are provided without warranty. The authors or license can not be held liable for any damages caused by the code.

data.py file is the data preparation file required for the deep learning models.
model*.py files are the deep learning segmentation models.
